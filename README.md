# 👋 Hey, I'm Ankit Basnet

I'm a senior Computer Science student at East Central University, graduating in December 2025.  
I enjoy building small projects, learning new technologies, and improving my problem-solving skills through code.

Right now, I’m focusing on **Java development** and backend programming while preparing for my **OPT** period after graduation.  
Most of my current work includes writing clean, simple code and experimenting with real-world concepts I’ve learned in class.
